<!-- Here a guideline for your report:

Find a dataset that you are interested in
Upload the .csv and check you data
Which is it your Explanatory and Response variable?
There is a correlation between the two?
This correlation implies causation?
Now fit your model in a (General) Linear Model (remember the assumptions)
Which model describes better your data? Explain
Remember to apply the general suggestion to your report:

add an appropriate header (e.g., title, author, date, output format)
add some headers and sub-headers
Add labels to the axes’ plot and add a title for each plot!
Have fun and try to make the report interesting for the reader! -->
