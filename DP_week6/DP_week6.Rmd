# Data practical

* Load some data (sets) and describe your data and its variables
* Formulate two questions about the data that you want to visualize
* [Decide how to visualize your variables](https://www.data-to-viz.com)
* Convert your data types if needed, e.g., [to factors](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/12-supp-factors/index.html)
* Create your plots and explain in prose what the data visualizes (see example above)
