## Skate music dataset

I load the same dataset that used in week 3. It is the dataset from The Pudding article by @wilber_good_2018. You can find the dataset [here](https://github.com/the-pudding/data/blob/master/skate-music/soundtrack_data.csv) or in the week 3 folder.

```{r}
skate <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-pudding/data/master/skate-music/soundtrack_data.csv")
```

### Filtering
Now, let's filter the skate dataset to look at "Electronic" music with a total of uses in the videos that is equal or superior to 10.
```{r}
skate_filter<-skate %>% filter(genre=="Electronic",tote>=10)
skate_filter %>% kable()
```

From this list, I only know M83. We can see that they are in fourth place of the most used electronic music in skate videos.  


### Selecting

Since there are a couple of columns we do not really care about, let's select those that matter. 

```{r}
skate_selected <- skate_filter %>% select(artist,tote,genre,year)
```
### Displaying rows

In the following code, the first rows are displayed. 
```{r}
head(skate_selected) %>% kable()
```


Now, we can find the last rows. 
```{r}
tail(skate_selected) %>% kable()
```

### Structure
Here, you can see the structure of the dataset. 
```{r}
str(skate_selected)
```
### Arranging

Now, let's arrange our data. It will show the rows ordered by "tote" from the highest to the lowest value.

```{r}
skate_arranged<-skate_selected %>% arrange(desc(tote,genre))
skate_arranged %>% kable()
```

We can see that the most popular electronic artist is Sol. 

### Summarizing

In the following code chunk, I decided to take the initial dataset to see the total of times each genre was used in skate videos. 
```{r}
total<-skate %>% group_by(genre) %>% summarize(total_use_of_genre=sum(tote)) %>% arrange(desc(total_use_of_genre))
total %>% kable()
```
### NA
Let's use a function to see if we have NA's in our data...
```{r}
any(is.na(skate))
```

If there were NA values in my dataset and I would want to exclude them, I would use "filter(!is.na(name_of_colum_where_there_are_NA))". But as we have seen with the previous formula there are none. 


## Joining two datasets 

![Friends Chandler - 'MERGE'lol](https://i.makeagif.com/media/6-14-2016/35CLe6.gif)

Let's 'merge' the `results_us_election_2016` and `murders` datasets. 
```{r}
head(full_join(results_us_election_2016,murders)) %>% kable()
```
I could look at the relationship between region and the votes for clinton, trump and others to understand. This could potentially tell us if there is a certain tendency to vote for either on of the candidates depending on which region you come from. I would probably start by filtering the "region" column.
