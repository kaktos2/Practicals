## Level 1 : Writing a report

### Level 1.1 : finding a topic

To write about the topic of my thesis or to write about something else, that is the question. Well, let's just briefly talk about it. 
I will be exploring **silence** the next couple of months, and probabably will wonder about it from time to time for the rest of my life. 

*Why even explore silence?*

  A. Silence has multiple meanings.

In the picture above,you can see olympic medalist Sky Brown, a thirteen year old professional skateboarder casually chilling on her board, mid-air.

The next gray bit shows how I loaded the library dplyr :

```{r, , message=F, warning=F}
library(dplyr) #explain what it's for?
```

In this r code chunk section, we see how I loaded the sleep dataset : 
```{r}
data()
data("sleep")   # i am loading the 'sleep' built-in dataset from R Studio
summary(sleep)  # with summary() we see basic information 
```
