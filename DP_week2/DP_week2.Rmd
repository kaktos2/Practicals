## Subjective experience of silence

For my Master thesis, or, at least, for my internship, I will be exploring the concept of **silence**. I like the concept of silence because it can mean different things for different persons but it can also be explored in so many different ways. 

Intuitively, silence for me means : 

1. The absence of **sound** : This idea is as fascinating as me as the idea of *nothingness*. What is the absence of sound, and does it even exist? If it exists,    can I experience it or does the absence of sound require no hearer?
2. The absence of **noise** : What I mean by noise is, for example, the sound of cars when you live near a road or the sound of construction work. 
3. The absence of **mental noise**: Say sometimes we may feel like our mind is full of thoughts that go everywhere at once. This is what I would call *mental noise*. So silence of mind would be something like breathing fresh air ? 

These are only a few ideas of what silence could mean, and this can vary with people. Some people find silence in environments I would call noisy and vice-versa. 

### Purple Hibiscus & Under the Udala Trees

Back in 2021, I did a semester in the English Master and we had to read Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's *Purple Hibiscus* and Chinelo Okparanta's *Under the Udala Trees*. I think the topic of silence had already started to grow on me slowly and I decided to analyze the topic of silence in this novel. I discovered a silence that was both oppressive and quietening as well as an expressive silence that allowed characters to communicate with each other.

Shoutout to @ramalingam_7_2021 for this sort of table with the pictures of the books I am mentioning. 


The following quote is from *Under the Udala Trees* and is another kind of silence. In this passage, the main character gets silenced by another character :

> 'There are punishments for people who’ve done what I’ve done,’ I began again, pulling myself away from him. ‘Stoning and dro-‘/ He placed a finger over my lips, and just like that, he hushed me, cancelled all the words that had been getting ready to make their way out of my mouth. [@okparanta_under_2017, p.233] 

### Sleep (loading a dataset)

Sleep is another domain that fits perfectly into the topic of silence. I think the idea of sleep without dreams can be conceived as a form of silence of our "conscious self". I have this idea that my "self" somewhat 'goes somewhere' or simply is silent for the time I go to sleep. 

In this r code chunk section, we see how I loaded the`sleep` dataset : 
```{r}
data(sleep) 
```
Let's see it displayed in a beautiful table. 
```{r,  message=F, warning=F}
library(knitr) # necessary to use the kable function
kable(sleep)
```

See you soon for a new data practical !
