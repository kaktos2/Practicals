# Practicals

Here on the github, I am kaktos2, but IRL my name is CÃ¡tia. 

This repository was originally created for a Data Science class for my master's in cognitive science. It contains 7 folders organized by week numbers. Each week we had specific instructions for what they should contain and since Week 1 was introduction, the folders start at week 2. Below, you will find a brief desctription of what the folders contain. 

You can find the dataset [here]( https://github.com/kaktos2/Practicals/tree/main/DP_week3) or in this folder just in case. 


Some practicals have bibliographies some do not, I apologize for that. Hopefully, I have cited the most important things. 

*By the way* DP stands for data practical.
