# Practicals

Here on the github, I am kaktos2, but IRL my name is CÃ¡tia. 

This repository was originally created for a Data Science class for my master's in cognitive science. It contains 7 folders organized by week numbers. Each week we had specific instructions for what they should contain and since Week 1 was introduction, the folders start at week 2. Below, you will find a brief desctription of what the folders contain. 

- [Week 3](https://github.com/kaktos2/Practicals/tree/main/DP_week3) : *load datasets from different sources* 
- [Week 4](https://github.com/kaktos2/Practicals/tree/main/DP_week4) : *Data wrangling with Dplyr*
- [Week 5](https://github.com/kaktos2/Practicals/tree/main/DP_week5) : *Data visualization I*
- [Week 6](https://github.com/kaktos2/Practicals/tree/main/DP_week6) : *Data visualization II*, here I used a dataset from a group project.
- [Week7](https://github.com/kaktos2/Practicals/tree/main/DP_week7) : *Data modeling*
- [Week 8](https://github.com/kaktos2/Practicals/tree/main/DP_week8): *Linear models*

Some practicals have bibliographies some do not, I apologize for that. Hopefully, I have cited the most important things. 

*By the way* DP stands for data practical.
