# Practicals

Here on the github, I am kaktos2, but IRL I am CÃ¡tia. 

This repository is for the Data science class in the Cognitive Science Master.  In this main folder, you will find circa 7 folders organized by week numbers. Thus, in each folder, you will find the practical linked with that specific week and sometimes a folder created by R studio that includes some plots. 

Some practicals have bibliographies some do not, I apologize for that. Hopefully, I have cited the most important things. 

I had a lot of fun including gifs here and there.
