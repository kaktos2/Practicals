# Practicals

Here on the github, I am kaktos2, but IRL my name is CÃ¡tia. 

This repository was originally created for a Data Science class for my master's in cognitive science. It contains 7 folders organized by week numbers and "DP" stands for *data practical*. Each week we had specific instructions for what the data practical should contain and since Week 1 was introduction class, the folders start at week 2. Below, you will find a brief desctription of what the .md file within the specific following folders contain. 
- [Week 2](https://github.com/kaktos2/Practicals/tree/main/DP_week2) : Using basic R markdown elements such as bullet points, bold and italics. 
- [Week 3](https://github.com/kaktos2/Practicals/tree/main/DP_week3) : **Load datasets from different sources** 
- [Week 4](https://github.com/kaktos2/Practicals/tree/main/DP_week4) : **Data wrangling with Dplyr**
- [Week 5](https://github.com/kaktos2/Practicals/tree/main/DP_week5) : **Data visualization I**
- [Week 6](https://github.com/kaktos2/Practicals/tree/main/DP_week6) : **Data visualization II**, here I used a dataset from a group project.
- [Week7](https://github.com/kaktos2/Practicals/tree/main/DP_week7) : **Data modeling**
- [Week 8](https://github.com/kaktos2/Practicals/tree/main/DP_week8): **Linear models**
