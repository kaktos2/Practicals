# Data practical

For this week's data practical, follow these steps (in which ever order works best for you and your data):

* Find a data set of interest -- if it is not tabular, make it tabular
* Load the data set and provide a description of its contents (what are the variables?) and data types
* Transform the data set into long format if it is in wide format
* Transform the data set into wide format if it is in long format
* Make sure your data is in [tidy format](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html)
* Take a column in your data set and split the columns values into new columns with `separate()`
* Take data from two or more columns and `unite()`
* Create a plot using `ggplot()`
