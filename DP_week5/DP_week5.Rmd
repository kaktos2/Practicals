## Data visualization


Here are our beloved packages (bibliography in the previous reports).

```{r , message=F, warning=F}

library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)

```

Here is my dataset of interest for this practical. I was looking for a fun dataset on the web but, I was getting lost in searching. 
Thus, I ended up choosing one of r's datasets named "warpbreaks". 

First, let's load it. 

```{r}
data(warpbreaks)
```

To understand this dataset, we need a bit of knowledge on weaving to understand what the variables represent.

This pitcure shows you what is meant by a warp.

Here is its structure.

```{r}
str(warpbreaks)
```
In this dataset, we find 1 numerical variable and 2 factor variables. The break is the number of breaks in a warp. There are two types of wool (A or B). And finally, there are three levels of tension which are low (L), medium (M) and high (H).



```{r}
data(starwars)
```

```{r}
starwars_long <- starwars %>% 
  pivot_longer(c("mass","birth_year"), names_to = "variable")
starwars_long %>% head() %>% kable()

```

```{r}
starwars_long %>% kable()
```



* Make sure your data is in [tidy format](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html)
* Take a column in your data set and split the columns values into new columns with `separate()`
* Take data from two or more columns and `unite()`
* Create a plot using `ggplot()`
