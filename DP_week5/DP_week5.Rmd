## Data visualization


Here are our beloved packages (bibliography in the previous reports).

Here is my dataset of interest for this practical. I was looking for a fun dataset on the web but, I was getting lost in searching. 
Thus, I ended up choosing one of r's datasets named "warpbreaks". 

First, let's load it. 

```{r}
data(warpbreaks)
```

To understand this dataset, we need a bit of knowledge on weaving to understand what the variables represent.

This picture shows you what is meant by a warp.

Here is its structure.

```{r}
str(warpbreaks)
```
In this dataset, we find 1 numerical variable and 2 factor variables. The break is the number of breaks in a warp. There are two types of wool (A or B). And finally, there are three levels of tension which are low (L), medium (M) and high (H).


```{r}
warpbreaks_long <- warpbreaks %>% 
  pivot_longer(breaks, names_to = "variable")
warpbreaks_long %>% kable()
```



### Marriage between 3 columns

Let's put together all the columns we have with the`unite()` function.  
```{r}
 warpbreaks_just_married<- warpbreaks%>%unite(unified)
```

Usually, I think together we are stronger, but in this case, putting the columns together doesn't seem to make much sense. 


### The break-up

It turns out, they weren't happy together. Let's work on separating them with the `separate()`function. I should have known better, the name of the dataset was warp**breaks**. They were obviously meant to break up :'( But oh well, sometimes it's for the better. 

```{r}
warpbreaks_divorced<-warpbreaks_just_married %>% separate(unified, into=c("breaks","wool", "tension"), sep="_")
head(warpbreaks_divorced)
```

### Plot 

Let's create a plot with our warpbreaks dataset. Let's plot wool and breaks to see the difference of breaks whether it's A or B. <!-- modify-->

```{r}
ggplot(warpbreaks,aes(tension,breaks,fill=wool)) + geom_boxplot() +  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Accent")

```

It seems wool "A" has the most breaks when the tension is low. I would have thought it would break when the tension is low.
